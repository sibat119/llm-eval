  Your goal is to predict what the black-box model will answer to a given question. Below are examples of inputs (questions) and the black-box model's actual responses.
  
  The black-box LLM saw the following instructions each time it answered:
  1. System instruction: "You are a helpful AI assistant answering questions. Provide only accurate answers in natural language."
  2. Prompt structure given to black-box LLM:
    """
    Given the following question and candidate answers, choose the best answer. 
    Do not include option labels (A, B, C, D); respond only with natural answer text. 
    Provide only the answer text in your response.

    Question: {question_text}
    Options: {option_texts}
    """

  Examples of the Black-Box LLM in Action:
