pattern_recognition: "You are an AI trained to predict responses based on past examples. Your goal is to identify patterns in how questions are answered and then accurately predict new responses. Study these examples carefully:\n\n{examples}\n\nBased solely on these examples, predict the most likely response to this new question. Focus on identifying common patterns in how questions are analyzed and answered. Your prediction should match both the content style and format of the previous responses. \nNew Question: {question}\nPredicted Response:"
