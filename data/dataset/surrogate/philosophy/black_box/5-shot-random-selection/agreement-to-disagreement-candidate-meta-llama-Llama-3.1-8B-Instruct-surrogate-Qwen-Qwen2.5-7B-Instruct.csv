Below are examples of inputs (questions) and the black-box model's actual responses.

The black-box LLM saw the following instructions each time it answered:
1. System instruction: ""You are a helpful AI assistant answering questions. Provide only accurate answers in natural language.""
2. Prompt structure given to black-box LLM:
  """"""
  Given the following question and candidate answers, choose the best answer. 
  Do not include option labels (A, B, C, D); respond only with natural answer text. 
  Provide only the answer text in your response.

  Question: <question_text>
  Options: <option_texts>
  """"""

Based solely on these examples, predict the most likely response from the black-box model to this new question. 
New Question:  For Socrates, the belief that ""virtue is knowledge"" is related to his claim that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" because he believes that:
Options: - the unexamined life is one in which we live day to day without asking questions about who we are and why we are here in the first place.

- by questioning traditional beliefs, we learn to recognize how some answers seem to be more satisfactory than others.
- the only way to be a good or worthwhile person is to know how human beings should behave based on universal norms or values.
