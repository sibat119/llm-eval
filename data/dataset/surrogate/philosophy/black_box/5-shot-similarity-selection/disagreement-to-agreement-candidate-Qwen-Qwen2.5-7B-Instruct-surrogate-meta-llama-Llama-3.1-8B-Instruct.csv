From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:
Options: - from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.
- since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.
- our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.
