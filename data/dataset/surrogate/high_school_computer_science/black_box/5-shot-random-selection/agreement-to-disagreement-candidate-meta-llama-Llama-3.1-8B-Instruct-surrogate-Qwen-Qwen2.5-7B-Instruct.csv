Based solely on these examples, predict the most likely response from the black-box model to this new question. 
New Question: Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.

 For example, if 1istl contains
 [""Macbeth"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Jane Eyre""]
 and 1ist2 contains
 [""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula, ""Macbeth"", ""Hamlet""],
 then newList will contain
 [""Dracula"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Hamlet"", ""Jane Eyre"", ""Macbeth""].

 The following procedures are available to create newList.
 Procedure
 Explanation
 Sort (list)
 Sorts list in alphabetical order and returns the resulting list.
 Combine (listl, list2)
 Creates a new list consisting of the entries from
 list1 followed by the entries from list2. The resulting list is returned.
 RemoveDuplicates (list)
 Iterates through list. If any two or more entries have the same value, the duplicate entries are removed so that any entry appears at most once. The resulting list is returned.

 Which of the following code segments will correctly create newList?
Options: - newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)
 newList ← RemoveDup1icates (newList)
- listl ← Sort (listl)
 list2 ← Sort (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← RemoveDuplicates (newList)
- listl ← RemoveDuplicates (listl)
 list2 ← RemoveDuplicates (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, 1ist2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)

 listl ← Sort (listl)

The bank decides to use a computer simulation of these two options to determine the average wait time for customers. Which of the following is NOT true about the bank's plan?""
Options: ""- The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.
- The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.
- The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.
- The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.""
