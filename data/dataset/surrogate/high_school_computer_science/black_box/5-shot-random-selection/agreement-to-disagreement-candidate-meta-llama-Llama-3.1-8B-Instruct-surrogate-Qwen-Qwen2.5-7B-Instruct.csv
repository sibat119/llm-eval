New Question: Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.

 [""Macbeth"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Jane Eyre""]
 and 1ist2 contains
 [""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula, ""Macbeth"", ""Hamlet""],
 then newList will contain
 [""Dracula"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Hamlet"", ""Jane Eyre"", ""Macbeth""].

 Procedure
 Explanation
 Sort (list)
 Sorts list in alphabetical order and returns the resulting list.
 Combine (listl, list2)

 list1 followed by the entries from list2. The resulting list is returned.
