New Question: A new bank plans to make customer convenience a priority by minimizing the amount of time a customer waits in line. The bank is considering two options: a single line where the customer at the front waits for the next available teller, or separate lines for each teller. The bank decides to use a computer simulation of these two options to determine the average wait time for customers. Which of the following is NOT true about the bank's plan?
Options: - The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.
- The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.
- The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.
- The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.

In this case, the question asks for an expression that evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, and false otherwise.

Option I is true when the person is at least 16 years old (old enough to drive) but also when they are at least 18 years old (old enough to vote), so it does not meet the condition.

Option II is true when the person is at least 16 years old (old enough to drive) but not at least 18 years old (not old enough to vote), which meets the condition.

Option III is true when the person is not at least 18 years old (not old enough to vote) but also when they are not at least 16 years old (not old enough to drive), so it does not meet the condition.

New Question: A Web site uses several strategies to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing user accounts. Which of the following is NOT an example of multifactor authentication?
Options: - Each employee for a company is issued a USB device that contains a unique token code. To log into a company computer, an employee must insert the USB device into the computer and provide a correct password.
- After logging into an account from a new device, a user must enter a code that is sent via e-mail to the e-mail address on file with the account.
- In order to log into an account, a user must provide both a password and a fingerprint that is captured using the user’s device.
- When a user enters an incorrect password more than two times in a row, the user is locked out of the account for 24 hours.

In this case, the code segment is as follows:
  r ← 1
   s ← 2
   t ← 3
   r ← s
   s ← t
