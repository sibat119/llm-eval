It only mentions that a man and a woman were late. Therefore, we cannot determine who the secretary was.  Analysis: This question requires inductive reasoning because it asks the test-taker to make an inference based on the information provided in the passage. The test-taker needs to analyze the passage and determine that there is not enough information to answer the question. The correct answer is ""Not enough information"" because the passage does not mention the secretary. The other options are incorrect because the passage does not provide any information about the secretary's gender.
