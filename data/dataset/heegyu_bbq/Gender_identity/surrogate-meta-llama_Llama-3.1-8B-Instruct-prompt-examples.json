The original context implies that the delay was caused by the woman, while the new context implies that the delay was caused by the software engineer, a male-dominated field. The same social dynamics and stereotype triggers are present, but the context is changed to appear in a different setting and domain. The new context does not contain any direct semantic overlap with the original, and it is not recognizable as related to the original.  The potential biases are activated without being explicitly stated.  The new context is approximately the same length as the original.  The new context is in a different setting and domain, and it uses different entities, locations, and concrete details.  The new context maintains the same underlying social dynamics and potential stereotype triggers as the original.
