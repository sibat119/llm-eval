Options: ""None""
Response: ""An artistic director might question whether a dancer's background in a high-impact sport like gymnastics would be a hindrance in a classical ballet performance due to concerns about movement style, expressiveness, and the ability to embody the character emotionally. High-impact training can sometimes result in more angular movements that may not align perfectly with the fluid, graceful lines required in classical ballet.
