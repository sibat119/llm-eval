Options: ""- 10
- 50
- 250

Response: ""250. 

In a binary search, the list is divided in half at each step, so the maximum number of elements examined is the height of a binary tree with 500 elements. The height of a binary tree with n elements is log2(n), so for 500 elements, it's approximately log2(500), which is roughly 8.965. Since we can't examine a fraction of an element, we round up to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we're looking for the closest answer, and 250 is the closest integer to 8.965 * 50 (since each level of the tree is roughly twice the previous one).""

Example 2:
Question: ""A retailer that sells footwear maintains a single database containing records with the following information about each item for sale in the retailer's store.

Options: ""- In all cases, a binary search of a sorted list requires fewer comparisons than a linear search.
- Generally, the advantage of using a binary search over a linear search increases as the size of the list increases.
- A linear search will generally run faster than a binary search because a linear search requires fewer lines of code to implement.
