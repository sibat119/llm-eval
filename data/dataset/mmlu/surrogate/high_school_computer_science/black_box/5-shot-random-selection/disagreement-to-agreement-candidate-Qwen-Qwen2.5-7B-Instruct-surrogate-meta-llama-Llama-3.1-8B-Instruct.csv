New Question: A new bank plans to make customer convenience a priority by minimizing the amount of time a customer waits in line. The bank is considering two options: a single line where the customer at the front waits for the next available teller, or separate lines for each teller. The bank decides to use a computer simulation of these two options to determine the average wait time for customers. Which of the following is NOT true about the bank's plan?
Options: - The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.
- The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.
- The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.
- The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.
